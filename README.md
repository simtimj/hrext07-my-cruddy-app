Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS


## Tasks

### Basic Reqs
- [ ] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [ ] How to caputure data? (web form)
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [ ] How to view data? (style?)
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this)

### Advanced Reqs
- [ ] Item that I added goes here...

General Idea
- An app that helps organize events based on time boxing technique.
- Can set an event and a length of time, to be set upon a daily timeline by dragging. 
(Will have to do manual time input if takes too long to implement).
- Can have notifications for specific events (such as the first event when changing 
subject of tasks, or other one off cases)
- Can set notification at before event, start of event, any where within event, and end.
- Can set different kind of break events, has title, length, notification as well, to
also be dragged upon into timeline. Or can set to automatically be between say
example: 2 coding blocks.


Scope For now
Day 1:
Make input that sets and saves events titles, their lengths, and notes.
Be able to modify specific events on one off basis.
Make timeline that the events can be layed onto.
Be able to move all events up or down a certain amount of time.
Plan for notifications next.
